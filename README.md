Hi, I'm Tim!ðŸ‘‹

As a self-taught web developer, I am passionate about creating dynamic and engaging user experiences. I wrote my first piece of code in the autumn of 2022 and have never looked back. I love to learn about new technologies and implement them to solve problems and create quality web applications.

I graduated from Andrei Neagoie's 'The Complete Web Developer: Zero to Mastery' in the spring of 2023. Since then I have worked on various personal and collaborative projects to enhance my skills as a developer, with a primary focus on JavaScript.

Below is a list of some of the technologies I have used in my web applications:
